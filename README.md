# T2J: Prompt Augmentation Framework for PyTorch-to-JAX Translation

## Overview

T2J is a prompt augmentation framework designed to improve Large Language Model (LLM)-based PyTorch-to-JAX code translation using open-source, freely available language models. This repository contains experimental implementations and evaluations of different prompt augmentation strategies for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of automated code translation between PyTorch and JAX frameworks.

## Motivation

The transition from PyTorch to JAX is becoming increasingly important as the machine learning community embraces JAX's functional programming paradigm and its superior performance for high-performance computing. However, manual translation between these frameworks is time-consuming and error-prone. T2J addresses this challenge by leveraging the capabilities of open LLMs with carefully designed prompt augmentation techniques.

## Evaluation

The framework includes comprehensive evaluation metrics:

- **Syntactic Correctness**: Valid JAX syntax generation
- **Semantic Equivalence**: Functional equivalence between original and translated code
- **Performance Metrics**: Translation accuracy and success rates
- **Human Evaluation**: Manual assessment of translation quality

## Results

[Results and findings will be documented here as experiments are completed]
